Installing via Composer
-----------------------

The recommended way to install is through
[Composer](http://getcomposer.org).

```bash
# Install Composer
curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
```

Next, update your project's composer.json file:

```javascript
{
    "require": {
        "jaydean/claredale-sync": "dev-master"
    }
}
```

After installing, you need to require Composer's autoloader:

```php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';
```
